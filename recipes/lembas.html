        <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees.</li>
                <li>Cut softened butter into the flour using a pastry blender until it has a crumbly consistency.</li>
                <li>Add brown sugar, cinnamon, and freshly grated nutmeg, mix.</li>
                <li>Beat the egg well in a small bowl, then add heavy cream and mix.</li>
                <li>Take 1 Tablespoon of the egg mixture and set aside.</li>
                <li>Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and mix until it forms a stiff, soft dough. <em>Do not overmix</em>.</li>
                <li>Dump the mixture onto a lightly floured surface and knead 3-4 times.</li>
                <li>Roll dough to approximately 3/4" thick.  Cut into 3 inch squares and transfer to a 
                    lightly greased cookie sheet, leaving about an inch of space between each square. Score the dough with a butter knife (do not cut all 
                    the way through) from corner to corner in both directions, forming an "X" on the dough. (See "note" below)</li>
                <li>Brush the tops of the squares with the reserved egg mixture.</li>
                <li>Bake for 12-13 minutes until it is set and lightly golden.</li>
                <li>If using mallorn leaves, allow lembas to cool and then wrap in mallorn leaves, securing with twine or raffia. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Note: If properly scored, lembas squares should break apart easily into 4 triangles.</p>
